Creating a .cube LUT (Look-Up Table) for a cinematic look involves defining specific color grading parameters. While I can't create files directly, I can guide you through the process of creating a .cube LUT using software like Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or even online LUT generators.

### Steps to Create a Cinematic LUT:

1. **Choose Your Software**: Use a video editing software that supports LUT creation, such as DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere Pro.

2. **Import Your Footage**: Load a clip that you want to grade.

3. **Color Grading**:
   - **Adjust Contrast**: Increase contrast to make the image pop.
   - **Color Wheels**: Use the color wheels to adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights. A common cinematic look involves adding a teal tint to the shadows and an orange tint to the highlights.
   - **Saturation**: Slightly reduce saturation for a more muted look, or adjust it to your preference.
   - **Curves**: Use RGB curves to create an S-curve for contrast and adjust the color channels for a stylized look.

4. **Export the LUT**:
   - In DaVinci Resolve, go to the "Color" tab, right-click on the node, and select "Generate 3D LUT."
   - In Adobe Premiere Pro, you can use the Lumetri Color panel and then export the LUT from the "Creative" tab.

5. **Save as .cube**: Ensure you save the LUT in the .cube format.

### Example LUT Settings for a Cinematic Look:
- **Contrast**: +20%
- **Shadows**: -10% Blue, +10% Green
- **Midtones**: +10% Red
- **Highlights**: +10% Orange
- **Saturation**: -10%
- **Curves**: S-curve applied to RGB channels.
