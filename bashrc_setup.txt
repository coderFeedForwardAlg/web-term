You can set up your system to automatically launch tmux with specific panes and windows when you start your computer. There are a couple of common approaches:

1. Using a script that runs tmux with your desired layout.
2. Configuring tmux itself with a configuration file (`.tmux.conf`).

### Example 1: Using a startup script
You can create a shell script, for example `start_tmux.sh`, with commands to set up your panes and windows. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tmux new-session -d -s mysession
tmux rename-window -t mysession:0 'Main'
tmux split-window -h -t mysession:0
tmux split-window -v -t mysession:0.1
tmux attach-session -t mysession
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x start_tmux.sh
```

And then, you can add a command to your `.bashrc` to run this script when you open a terminal:

```bash
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    ~/path/to/start_tmux.sh
fi
```

### Example 2: Using `.tmux.conf`
You can also configure your tmux layout directly in `.tmux.conf`. For example:

```bash
# Create a new session with specific windows and panes
new-session -d -s mysession
rename-window -t mysession:0 'Main'
split-window -h -t mysession:0
split-window -v -t mysession:0.1
attach-session -t mysession
```

Then, in your `.bashrc`, you can automatically start tmux with this configuration:

```bash
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
fi
```

### Important:
- To prevent the terminal from closing when tmux exits, ensure your script or command is set up correctly.
- You might want to add checks to only start tmux if it's not already running.
